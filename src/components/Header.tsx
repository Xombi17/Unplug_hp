    This component appears to be a header logo/title that links to the homepage.
    It contains a graduation cap icon and the "unPlug" title.
    It's likely used in a navigation bar or header section.
    
    Note: There are errors because:
    1. 'Link' is not imported (should be imported from a routing library like Next.js)
    2. 'GraduationCap' icon is not imported (should be imported from 'lucide-react')
